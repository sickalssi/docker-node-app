## Part 1 - Cloud Native Apps Concepts

**3 Benefits of cloud-native applications**

What makes cloud-native development so valuable? The following three qualities are what have savvy companies paying attention:

1. Adaptability

Cloud-native applications can change with the needs of the business without creating dependencies that lock customers into a particular version of the software.

For example, if a company wants to make an application available on mobile devices, it can build the mobile front end and use APIs to access data on the server without modifying any code on the back end. This loose coupling makes it possible to make changes to either application without breaking it.

2. Scalability

Cloud-native applications use software-defined infrastructure to reduce or eliminate hardware dependency. This approach adds commodity servers for horizontal scalability rather than requiring the addition of more expensive processors, storage, and memory to existing servers. Horizontal scalability is what makes massive cloud services like Amazon and Facebook possible.

3. Portability

Using containers, developers can write applications that run on everything from a smartphone to a mainframe without changing the code. With the growing popularity of “edge computing,” a distributed processing architecture that pushes automated decisions to the far reaches of the network, it’s ideal to have the ability to deploy applications wherever they’re needed.
